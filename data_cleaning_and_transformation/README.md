This folder contains all the data cleaning and transformation steps that were carried out mainly using PostgreSQL. Only two steps were carried out, at the start, using Microsoft Excel, due to technical issues in importing data from CSV files into PgAdmin4.

It also contains the SQL code needed to clean and transform each table prior to data analysis.
